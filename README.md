# Trader Desk

An eleven-agent trade research desk that runs entirely in your browser. It has no
server, no account and no build step, so it hosts free on GitHub Pages, Netlify
or Cloudflare Pages.

**Not financial advice.** This is software that does arithmetic on historical
data. It cannot see the future and cannot place orders.

## The agents

## Data

Paste free keys in **Settings**. They're stored only in your browser and sent
only to their provider.

- **Twelve Data** (recommended for prices): ~600 daily bars, 800 calls/day free.
- **Alpha Vantage**: the free tier gives only 100 daily bars, too short for a 200-day average or a 12-month backtest.
- **Finnhub**: news.
- **CSV upload**: any `Date,Open,High,Low,Close[,Adj Close],Volume` export.
- **Demo**: synthetic prices seeded from the ticker name, clearly bannered. Not real.

## Host it free

**GitHub Pages:** the workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the
site whenever `main` changes. Once: repo **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub
Actions**. The site appears at `https://dheeru284.github.io/trader-desk/`.

**Netlify / Cloudflare Pages:** connect the repo, leave the build command empty,
set the publish directory to `.` (the repo root).

**Locally:** open `index.html` in a browser. It uses no modules, so `file://`
works.

## Known limits

- Daily bars only; the Monte Carlo checks stop and target on closes, so it misses intraday touches but does include gap-through-stop losses.
- Bootstrapped i.i.d. returns keep the fat tails of the past year but not volatility clustering, regime changes, or earnings jumps that didn't occur in the window.
- Options are valued at intrinsic at expiry only: no Greeks, IV, early exit or options-chain data. You enter the premium.
- The backtest is long-only and has no survivorship-bias or dividend adjustment. A handful of trades is not evidence.
- Sentiment is a word count on headlines. No social-media feed is connected.
- Alerts only check while the page is open and a ticker is loaded.
- Whether a provider allows browser (CORS) requests is the provider's choice and can change. If a source fails, switch source or use CSV.
